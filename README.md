## Atomic Many-body Perturbation theory in the Screened Coulomb Interaction

[_ampsci_](https://ampsci.dev/)
is a c++ program for high-precision atomic structure calculations of single-valence systems, developed and maintained by [Benjamin M. Roberts](https://broberts.io/), University of Queensland, Australia

It solves the correlated Dirac equation using the Hartree-Fock + correlation potential method (based on Dzuba-Flambaum-Sushkov method) to produce a set of atomic wavefunctions and energies.
The method is fully relativistic, includes electron correlations, all-orders screening and hole-particle interaction, finite-nuclear size, Breit interaction, radiative QED effects, RPA for matrix elements, and structure radiation/renormalisation.
QED is included via the Flambaum-Ginges radiative potential method.
Can solve for continuum states with high energy, and calculate ionisation cross sections with large energy/momentum transfer.

Designed to be fast, accurate, and easy to use.
The "modules" system (see [doc/modules.md](doc/modules.md)) makes it simple to add your own routines to use the atomic wavefunctions to calculate whatever properties you may be interested in.

* The code is on GitHub: [github.com/benroberts999/ampsci](https://github.com/benroberts999/ampsci)
* See [ampsci.dev/](https://ampsci.dev/) for full documentation
* A full description of the physics methods and approximations, including references,
is given in the physics documentation: [ampsci.pdf][man-url].
* **Important:** this is a _pre-release_ version of the code: not fully tested or documented, and should not be used for publishable calculations (without consultation)

## Compilation and usage

Full documentation available online: [ampsci.dev/](https://ampsci.dev/).
Divided into sections:

 1. Usage intructions, input options
    * Compilation instructions (for linux/mac/windows): [doc/compilation.md](doc/compilation.md)
    * Detailed info on all input options: [doc/ampsci_input.md](doc/ampsci_input.md)
    * A basic step-by-step tutorial: [doc/tutorial.md](doc/tutorial.md)
    * A more advanced tutorial: [doc/tutorial_advanced.md](doc/tutorial_advanced.md)
      * See also: _doc/examples/ampsci.in_ -- an example/template input file
      * In _doc/examples/_ there are several example input files, with the expected output; use these to test if everything is working

 2. Physics documentation: [ampsci.dev/ampsci.pdf](https://ampsci.dev/ampsci.pdf)
    * Description of physics/methods used in the code
    * Includes many references to the works where the methods implemented here were developed.

 3. Modules
    * The modules system allows the easy calculation of any atomic properties after the wavefunction has been calculated. See [doc/modules.md](doc/modules.md) for description
    * The code is designed so that you can easily create your own modules. See [doc/writing_modules.md](doc/writing_modules.md) for details

 4. Code documentation -- details on classes/functions in the code
    * Available online: [ampsci.dev/](https://ampsci.dev/)
    * This should only be required if you plan to edit the code or add new modules

**Quick start**:

* The `setup.sh` bash script should compile and build ampsci
  * It uses only defaults, and may not work on all systems.
    See above instructions for full guide to compilation.
  * It assumes dependencies have already been installed. If not, see next:
* The `install-dependencies.sh` bash script should install all required dependencies.
  * It uses only defaults, and may not work on all systems.
  * As upsream repositories update, this may fall out-of-date
* See which ampsci input options are available: `./ampsci -a`
  * See available input options for each input block by following with its name
  * e.g., `./ampsci -a HartreeFock`
* Check which Modules are aviable: `./ampsci -m`
  * See available input options for each module by following with its name
  * e.g., `./ampsci -m MatrixElements`
* Check which operators are aviable: `./ampsci -o`
  * See available input options for each operator by following with its name
  * e.g., `./ampsci -o hfs`

Looking for atomic ionisation form-factors for dark-matter-electron scattering?

* See `Kionisation` module (`./ampsci -m Kionisation`)
