/*
Testing the B-splines:

First part compared energies and hyperfine constants between HF states and splines - see tables in ampsci.pdf:
Table I "Comparison between energies of spline (DKB) basis orbitals and finite-difference Hartree-Fock orbitals."
and
Table II "Magnetic dipole hyperfine constants A ... calculated using the finite-difference Hartree-Fock orbitals, and the DKB basis"

Second-part calculated RPA corrections to E1 using TDHF and diagram methods.
Diagram method uses basis, so if these agree it is a good test of the basis.
